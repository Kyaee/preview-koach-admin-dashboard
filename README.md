## Description

PR that includes the following features:
1. **Add UI helpers that provides context to application statuses:**
    - Display description about a coach application once a status label is hovered
    - Implement a help icon or text element located above the coach application table. When clicking, will implement a modal that displays a comprehensive "Coach Application Guide" table, outlining each status's meaning and associated admin actions.
2. **Additional Confirmation for Admin Status Changes:**
    - Show an additional confirmation dialog, when an admin changes a coach's application status
    - Text indicating that "This action cannot be undone. The application cannot be reverted to a previous status after saving."
    - Hide previous statuses upon admin change, preventing reversion of status.
3. **Export filtered table data as `.CSV` file**
